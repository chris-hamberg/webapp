    <h3>About Page:</h3>
    <h2>This responsive web application is built with Python3, SQLite3, 
        Jinja2, and Bootstrap3.</h2>
    
    <p>It is a compiliation of works. There are embedded applications
        navigable in the CMS tree on the right side bar (located below if 
        you're on mobile.) In addition to the embedded applications, 
        there are several proofs from the field of computational mathematics, 
        namely discrete mathematics. These are also my work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Note that you must be logged on for some applications to work. The 
        embedded twitter application (NOT EMBEDDED YET) requires the 
        OAuth credentials provided by Twitter.com. The credentials are stored, 
        but encrypted. Only you know the decryption key.

    <p> User passwords are not stored in the database or anywhere on the 
    website, hence, passwords are secured. Only the registered user knows his 
    password.

    The same unknown password, serves as an ecryption key for
    sensative data.
